### design principles
- symmetrical design
- 8 buttons
- no visible screws
- not-too-bad middle click
- adjustable surface sensor position. with PAW3395 breakout pcb. https://github.com/badjeff/paw3395-pcb
- mini finger trackball. with PMW3610 breakout pcb. https://github.com/badjeff/pmw3610-pcb
- mechnical trackball tightness control
- powered by [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) => OSS, on-devie profiling, say no to (logxtxxh|razxx) eco-system
- optimized for fingertip grip and claw grip
- rigid. (Zero crackly sound)
- stupidly easy facelifting. (see CAD file, open soruced, playback the timeline)
- ligthweight. (Errr, under 80g, made by PLA body with two sensors)
- medium size (112mm x 61mm x 38mm)
- fair battery life
- silent tactile switches
- conventional scroll wheel option

*: pogo pin and static ceramic bearings for trackball variant only. rotary encoder for scroll wheel variant only.

**: to implement PAW3395 sensor position adjustable from bottom of the body after assemble, o-rings and spacers are used to secure sensor breakout pcb on chassis.

***: need few heat set inserts if parts are going to be resin printed. all screw holes would fit m2 screws by design, requires to un-supressed feature in fusion360 CAD file to enlarge some m2 screw holes and count how many insert is needed.

### building guide / tips

- NOT for beginner. Requiring experience of building at least one wireless keyboard on [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk).
- print chassis plate with PLA, easier to screw
- print trackball socket with resin printing
- lens-to-Surface distance must >1mm & <2mm. Assuming all mouse feet is ~0.65mm thick.
- both optical sensor breakout pcb (and its lens) has the same width and height, that both can fit in the sensor rail. Therefor, surface facing sensor would be swapped to PMW3610 (yeah, dual 3610 build) if +0.5mm to all mouse feet regarding different lens focus distance.
